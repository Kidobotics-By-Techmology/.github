# Kidobotics By Techmology

Welcome to Kidobotics By Techmology! This organization is dedicated to creating an e-learning platform for robotics training courses that use Techmology's Mobot educational kits. The platform will include a sales showcase for different kits, a registration system for face-to-face courses, and controlled access to resources, among other features.
